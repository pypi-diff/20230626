-# Example Package
-
-This package contains most of the key code that I used in the first half of 2023 for the Reddit Deliberation Project. 
-The fucntions are explained here, guides for setting up variables to be compatible with these functions are explained, and an example is given at the bottom. 
-Any code that I used that isn't here was already part of another package, like matplotlib or networkx. 
-
-### * SETTING UP VARIABLES/ARRAYS * ###
-
-In order to be compatible with the code as I have written it, I would recommend following this set up. 
-Use the following code to initialise your actor and comments lists: 
-```
-actorList = [i for i in range(noActors)]
-commentsList = [i for i in range(noActors,(noActors+timeSteps))]
-```
-This ensures that each potential actor and potential comment are initialised in advance, which was one of the properties of the method I used, and it means each actor and comment's ID matches its row/column in the adjacency array. This code is captured in the function initialise_lists for convenience. 
-
-The commentOwnersList is a list that contains each actor who posted a comment in the order that they posted them. The index of each actor corresponds to the index of the comment in the commentList that they posted. 
-
-
-### * FUNCTIONS NOT IN THIS PACKAGE * ###
-
-Functions for the actor layer measures are all contained in the Network X package, and are listed below: 
-```
-cliques = len(list(nx.enumerate_all_cliques(A.to_undirected())))
-transitivity = nx.transitivity(A)
-reciprocity = nx.overall_reciprocity(A)
-clustering = nx.average_clustering(A)
-```
-I used matplotlib and Gephi for all the graphing and visuals. A tutorial for the 95% confidence elipses is under this link https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/confidence_ellipse.html, since that took me longer to find on account of being in the examples section of the documentation, rather than the reference.

+# ActSecModel Package
+
+This package contains most of the key code that I used in the first half of 2023 for the Reddit Deliberation Project. 
+The fucntions are explained here, guides for setting up variables to be compatible with these functions are explained, and an example is given at the bottom. 
+Any code that I used that isn't here was already part of another package, like matplotlib or networkx. 
+
+# SETTING UP VARIABLES/ARRAYS
+
+In order to be compatible with the code as I have written it, I would recommend following this set up. 
+Use the following code to initialise your actor and comments lists: 
+```
+actorList = [i for i in range(noActors)]
+commentsList = [i for i in range(noActors,(noActors+timeSteps))]
+```
+This ensures that each potential actor and potential comment are initialised in advance, which was one of the properties of the method I used, and it means each actor and comment's ID matches its row/column in the adjacency array. This code is captured in the function initialise_lists for convenience. 
+
+The commentOwnersList is a list that contains each actor who posted a comment in the order that they posted them. The index of each actor corresponds to the index of the comment in the commentList that they posted. 
+
+
+# FUNCTIONS NOT IN THIS PACKAGE
+
+Functions for the actor layer measures are all contained in the Network X package, and are listed below: 
+```
+cliques = len(list(nx.enumerate_all_cliques(A.to_undirected())))
+transitivity = nx.transitivity(A)
+reciprocity = nx.overall_reciprocity(A)
+clustering = nx.average_clustering(A)
+```
+I used matplotlib and Gephi for all the graphing and visuals. A tutorial for the 95% confidence elipses is under this link https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/statistics/confidence_ellipse.html, since that took me longer to find on account of being in the examples section of the documentation, rather than the reference.

+- RETURNS: The integer index of the actor chosen for activation (in my program, each actor was assigned a number from 0 upwards, so this index was also the actor's ID, and later code relfects this. The same was not true for comments)

+
+A fucntion that creates the binsList for uniform activation.
+- *n.* The number of actors.
